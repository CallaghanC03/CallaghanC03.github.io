title: "Glacier Loss by Latitude"
excerpt: "In a three-person group we measured the loss of glaciers in national parks, which was then changed to multiple latitudes using three states. This was done by using MODISâ€™s NDSI spectral index in Google Earth Engine. We selected data from August to reduce the amount of snow cover and because glacial melt peaks in August. The rasters were exported and then uploaded into ArcGIS Pro to calculated\ glacier loss using a binary conditional classification, raster math, and an area calculation by pixel size. Results were then compiled in Excel to calculate the total and percentage losses for each national park and the average latitudes in the three states studied. Results were analyzed and a poster was produced. Graphics and Charts Below:.<br/><img src='/images/381_git.png'>"
